Being a data scientist is about collecting, analyzing and interpreting data in order to problem solve a real world problem. The data is typically large in size and may need to be restructured in order for it to be readable and analyzed.

The major knowledge areas include problem solving, programming and engineering solutions. 

Data scientists and statisticians have a lot in common to include their use and knowledge of statistical analysis, programming and data visualization skills. They do have some differences though, data scientists hold a focus on machine learning and automation while statisticians hold more of a focus on mathematical concepts like significance testing and manual data collection. The data that data scientists work with tends to be messier and larger than the data that statisticians work with.

When I read about these two areas, I view myself with more of a math and statistics background versus a programming and machine engineering background. This makes me feel like I gravitate more towards a statistician role versus a data scientist role.
