## I am currently a beginner blogger!

While not sure the exact *theme* of my code that I plan on posting, I do hope to include some fun and interesting insight!  
* BUT, at the moment I...  
    + Feel I have a lot to learn  
    + Think I am going to enjoy programming with R
    + Find that everytime I make a list, my spacing is off
        + I have to recount spaces at least three times to get it right

Here are some images I found **aestheticly** pleasing:

*I am still learning how to add pictures*

In the mean time...**enjoy** the following links:
