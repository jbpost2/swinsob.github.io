## I am currently a beginner blogger!

While not sure the exact *theme* of my code that I plan on posting, I do hope to include some fun and interesting insight!  
* BUT, at the moment I...  
    + Feel I have a lot to learn  
    + Think I am going to enjoy programming with R
    + Find that everytime I make a list, my spacing is off
        + I have to recount spaces at least three times to get it right

Here are some images I found **aestheticly** pleasing:

{r graphics, out.width = "800px", echo = false}

Here you can say lots of fun things about your site.

Maybe say a some things about yourself.

Or maybe what you plan to blog about.
